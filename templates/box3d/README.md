## Run it

It's plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step and no dependencies. Run locally, it contacts no other website.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Three.js and the fonts ship in `vendor/` and `fonts/`, so it also works offline.

Then open http://localhost:8000.

## How it's built

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `index.html`, `css/app.css` | The page and its styles |
| `js/app.js`, `js/stage.js`, `js/ui.js`, `js/kit.js` | The shared Glassbox 3D engine: chapters, 3D stage, controls, quiz, video director |
| `js/chapters/*.js` | One file per chapter: the 3D model, controls, text, key terms, quiz and video scenes |
| `glassbox.json` | Title, question, explainer beats, key terms, browser storage and credits shown on {{DOMAIN}} |
| `reel` in each chapter | The storyboard the Glassbox studio records into short videos |
| `glassbox/` | The published video, slides, thumbnail and post copy |
| `fonts/`, `vendor/three/` | Self-hosted Geist and Instrument Serif (SIL OFL 1.1) and three.js (MIT) |
